I normally dont initiate talks, i'm very quiet and a bit awkward too. PT-BR/eng.

 I'm offtab most of the times, so w2i ALWAYS unless its obvious i'm ontab.

If im sitting alone, then you're free to c+h without asking! If i'm already with someone, either ask or just DNI.

DO NOT copy my skins, ASK for inspo, please. It's silly but it makes me highly uncomfortable. 

This account isn't JUST for follow spam, i still use it around, but do block me if the follow is unwanted.

I enjoy dating sims & visual novels, great god grove, slenderverse & crp, SOAD, rayman, dunmesh, LMK, STH nd some other stuff!

I'm a yumeshipper! ^_^ i yumeship with my friend's oc Iornidas ,. just needed 2 mention him.
